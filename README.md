# üëã Hi, I'm Sudharsan (1000milesdrunk)

### Software Engineer | Backend Architect | UI Developer

---

**About Me**

- üõ†Ô∏è **Backend:** Java 21 | Spring Boot | Spring Security | Spring Session | ABAC | Maven/Gradle | Kafka | gRPC | Microservices  
- üé® **Frontend:** HTML | CSS | JavaScript (plain & modular) | jQuery | Knockout.js (migrating out) | Freemarker | Tailwind (aware) | React (learning hands-on)
- üí° **Current Focus:**  
  - Migrating legacy Freemarker + Knockout.js code to plain, modular JavaScript  
  - Removing Knockout, prioritizing per-form modular JS over monolithic scripts  
  - Stack migration to modern Java & Spring ecosystem  
- üß© **Interests:** Puzzles, logical teasers, and system-level problem solving

**How I Work**

- Advocate for modularization, performance optimization (caching, layout reuse), and real-world use cases  
- Strong believer in high-quality code: Spotless, Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs, IntelliJ default formatting  
- Fast learner, often tackling complex migrations and backend architecture challenges solo  
- Enjoys solving "annoying" problems others avoid  
- Values clean code, system improvements, and coding standards (even if underappreciated!)

**Recent Challenges & Focus Areas**

- Migrating JavaScript forms to load only what's needed (no more monolithic files)
- Removing Knockout, not integrating React (for now)
- Pre-commit hooks, IDE performance (IntelliJ vs Eclipse), Burp Suite workflows
- Trunk-based development & exploring SaaS side-project ideas
- Experimenting with Gradle and event-driven architectures (Kafka, gRPC)
- Learning:  
  - Advanced JavaScript  
  - React (from theory to dynamic apps)  
  - Functional programming in Java  
  - GraphQL (mostly queries)

**Fun Facts**

- I learn faster than peers, but my favorite wins are tough migrations and untangling messy codebases.
- I love logic puzzles and teasers to keep my mind sharp.
- My mission: Make code cleaner, faster, and easier for everyone.
